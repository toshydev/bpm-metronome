# BPM-Metronome
Simple BPM-Calculator to measure beats per minute and Metronome(coming soon)

## Getting-Started
To start using the BPM-Calculator and Metronome you first need to clone this repo:
`git clone https://github.com/toshymoshy/bpm-metronom`

Next you need to have Python 3 installed.
Check your Python version with:
`python3 --version`

BPM-Calculator and Metronome are using the _pygame_ library so make sure you have that installed as well:
`python3 -m pip install pygame`
or just use the _requirements.txt_ file I have added:
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Start BPM-Calculator
Now you can start the program by just running the bpm.py with python3 after you _cd_ into the directory you cloned in the beginning:
`python3 bpm.py`

Enjoy :)
